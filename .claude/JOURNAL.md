1. **Task - JupyterLab DOCX Reader Extension**: Implement JupyterLab extension to open and view DOCX files in the browser<br>
    **Result**: Created full-featured extension that converts DOCX files to PDF on-the-fly. Used python-docx and reportlab for pure Python conversion (no system dependencies). Implemented server-side API handler for document conversion with base64 encoding for transmission. Frontend displays PDF using embed tag for better browser compatibility. Supports paragraphs, headings, and tables with proper formatting. Includes comprehensive error handling with detailed tracebacks. Added debug and info level logging on server side for monitoring.
